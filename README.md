## Identification of the *Cicer arietinum* aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily

In this work we will see the next points:

* Search for candidate proteins
* Checking ALDH conserved domains
* BLASTP of 'aldhcicer' against *C. arietinum* genome
* Characterization of aldehyde dehydrogenases of *C. arietinum*
* Classification of *C. arietinum* aldehyde dehydrogenases
* Phylogeny
* Duplication Analysis
* Expression in silico
* Code availability

Every step is deeply explained in the [TFM](https://github.com/RocioCarmonaMolero/TFMweb/blob/master/TFM.md) file.
