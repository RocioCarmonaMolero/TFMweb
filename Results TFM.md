## Identification and characterization of aldehyde dehydrogenases of C. arietinum

The identification process of the CAALDH is presented in Figure 1. Considering that the search was made with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the legumes Glycine max and Medicago truncatula, we can conclude that we have covered an adequate spectrum of species that, by homology of sequences, will allow us to identify all the aldehyde dehydrogenases of Cicer arietinum.

The completeness and availability of the chickpea genome together with database searches allowed the identification of 37 chickpea ALDH proteins encoded by 29 CaALDH genes (Table 1). These genes encode proteins with a range of 134 (CaALDH3H1j) to 755 (CaALDH18B3d) aa in length. The number of exons of the CaALDH genes varies from 3 (CaALDH3H1j) to 21 (CaALDH18B3a, CaALDH18B3d and CaALDH18B3e). The corresponding molecular weights range between 15.07 and 81.90 kDa; and the predicted isoelectric points between 4.34 and 9.49 (Table 2). The wide range of pI suggests that chickpea ALDH proteins can function in very different subcellular environments.

We observed that families 5, 6, 11, 12 and 22 are defined by a single gene in chickpea, similar to Arabidopsis, O. sativa, S. italica, S. bicolor, E. parvulum and E. salsugineum (Table 3); suggesting that these families constitute ALDH 'house-keeping' genes, involved in the central metabolism of plants and the preservation of the levels of non-toxic aldehydes. Families 2, 3 and 18 are comparatively abundant in C. arietinum. Family 3 (10 genes) and family 18 (6 genes) have a higher number of members in chickpea than in the rest of the plant species described so far. ALDH3 proteins constitute one of the most widespread and diverse groups of ALDH genes in plant species (Brocker et al., 2013).
There are no CaALDH genes in families 19, 21, 23 and 24. Families 21 and 23 have been found to contain only primitive terrestrial plant genes (Chen et al., 2002), and ALDH24 seems to be unique to single-celled alga C. reinhardtii (Wood & Duff, 2009); suggesting that these three families may have played an important role in the evolution of lower plants and subsequently were lost in higher plants. Family 19 has only been found in tomato (S. lycopersicum), so it could have evolved specifically in this lineage (Jimenez-Lopez et al., 2016).

**Figure 2**. CaALDH identification scheme. Own functions appear in color. Proteins from *Arbidopsis, G. max* and *Medicago* were used as a query in BLASTP searches against the reference genome of the chickpea. The result of this was cleaned by using R scripts to avoid repetitions. The chickpea proteins that did not have the ALDH domains were eliminated and another BLASTP was run against the *Cicer* genome to ensure that we were including all the CAALDH and detecting the un predicted ones. This resulted in 37 aldehyde dehydrogenases encoded by the chickpea genome.
