## Identification and characterization of aldehyde dehydrogenases of C. arietinum

The identification process of the CaALDH is shown in Figure 1. Considering the species of the search, the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* and the legumes *Glycine max* and *Medicago truncatula*, we can conclude to have covered an adequate spectrum of species that, by homology of sequences, will allow us to identify all the aldehyde dehydrogenases of *Cicer arietinum*.

The availability of the complete chickpea genome together with database searches allowed the identification of 37 chickpea ALDH proteins encoded by 29 *CaALDH* genes (Table 1). These genes encode proteins with a range of 134 (CaALDH3H1j) to 755 (CaALDH18B3d) aa of length. The number of exons of the *CaALDH* genes varies from 3 (CaALDH3H1j) to 21 (CaALDH18B3a, CaALDH18B3d and CaALDH18B3e). The corresponding molecular weights range between 15.07 and 81.90 kDa; and the predicted isoelectric points between 4.34 and 9.49 (Table 2). The wide range of pI suggests that chickpea ALDH proteins work in very different subcellular environments.

We observed that families 5, 6, 11, 12 and 22 are defined by a single gene in chickpea, similar to *Arabidopsis, O. sativa, S. italica, S. bicolor, E. parvulum* and *E. salsugineum* (Table 3); suggesting that these families constitute ALDH house-keeping genes, involved in the plants central metabolism and the preservation of non-toxic aldehydes levels. Families 2, 3 and 18 are comparatively abundant in *C. arietinum*. Family 3 (10 genes) and family 18 (6 genes) have a higher number of members in chickpea than any plant species described so far. ALDH3 proteins constitute one of the most widespread and diverse groups of ALDH genes in plant species (Brocker et al., 2013).
There are no *CaALDH* genes in families 19, 21, 23 and 24. Families 21 and 23 have been found to contain only primitive terrestrial plant genes (Chen et al., 2002), and ALDH24 appears only in the single-celled alga *C. reinhardtii* (Wood & Duff, 2009); suggesting that these three families may have played an important role in the evolution of lower plants and subsequently were lost in higher plants. Family 19 is found only in tomato (*S. lycopersicum*), so it evolved specifically in this lineage (Jimenez-Lopez et al., 2016).

**Figure 2**. CaALDH identification scheme. Own functions appear in color. Proteins from *Arabidopsis, G. max* and *Medicago* were used as a query in BLASTP searches against of the chickpea reference genome. The result of this was cleaned with R scripts to avoid repetitions. Chickpea proteins without the ALDH domains were deleted and another BLASTP was run against the *Cicer* genome to ensure the inclusion of every CaALDH and the detection of the unpredicted ones. This resulted in 37 aldehyde dehydrogenases encoded by the chickpea genome.
